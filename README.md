## üöÄ About Me  

### üî¨ From Lab Coat to Code Editor
My journey began in process development, where I combined hands-on scientific work with automation to optimize workflows and improve efficiency. This experience sparked my passion for coding as I created solutions to streamline complex systems and solve challenging problems. Over time, this passion evolved into more traditional software engineering, where I now build impactful solutions such as web applications, microservices, and other scalable systems. Today, I design cloud-native solutions that bridge the gap between discovery and innovation, driving meaningful outcomes.
